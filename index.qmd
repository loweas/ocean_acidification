<br>Coral reefs form the backbone of Hawai'i's nearshore ecosystems, supporting high biodiversity and delivering substantial ecological and economic benefits. Although they cover just 0.2% of the seafloor globally, Hawaiian coral reefs account for approximately 85% of all coral reefs in the United States. These ecosystems support about a quarter of all marine species and provide essential services, including fishery habitat, coastal protection, recreation, and tourism. In the Main Hawaiian Islands (MHI), coral reefs generate roughly $800 million per year in value from fishing, recreation, and other activities.

Climate change poses growing threats to Hawai'i's coral reefs. Two primary drivers of risk are rising ocean temperatures and ocean acidification (OA). Warming ocean waters can disrupt the symbiosis between corals and their algae, leading to coral bleaching events. Prolonged or severe bleaching can result in widespread coral mortality. Simultaneously, increased concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂) are absorbed by the ocean, increasing the concentration of hydrogen ions by about 30% since pre-industrial times and lowering the saturation state of aragonite, a mineral essential for coral skeletons. These changes make it more difficult for corals to grow and maintain their structures and can lead to cascading effects throughout the reef ecosystem and food web.

Assessing reef vulnerability and quantifying ecosystem degradation require spatially explicit analyses that capture both ecological dynamics and community-level impacts. However, much of our understanding comes from global models that fail to capture the fine-scale variability and local oceanographic conditions essential for Hawai‘i, limiting the scientific foundation for effective management and policy decisions.

Our study addresses this gap through integrated modeling. We combine high-resolution projections of OA and temperature with spatially explicit ecosystem modeling that tracks coral, fish, and fishery changes under three climate scenarios. These ecological projections are linked to recreational reef use values, providing an integrated perspective on climate-driven impacts to both marine ecosystems and dependent communities.

## Downscaled Projections and Novelty of OA in the MHI

OA impacts in Hawai‘i are shaped by the islands’ unique physical and oceanographic context. The MHI are located within the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, a major ocean current system that shapes local water temperature, chemistry, and other characteristics. [@cr-north-pacific-subtropical-gyre]

The region's steep bathymetry, with volcanic mountains rising from an abyssal plain over 6,000 meters deep to heights up to 4,000 meters above sea level, interacts with persistent northeasterly trade winds. This interaction disrupts currents, generating eddies and localized upwelling that drive biogeochemical dynamics. [@cr-ocean-bathymetry]

:::{#cr-ocean-bathymetry}
![](/assets/images/lucia/ocean_bathymetry.png)
:::

These dynamic oceanographic conditions influence how OA impacts coral reefs, which mostly fringe the shallow (less than 5 km from shore) coastlines of the MHI, complicating predictions of reef vulnerability and resilience. Accurately characterizing these local conditions is essential for understanding and protecting Hawai'i's reefs as ocean chemistry and temperature shift with climate change. [@cr-fringing-reefs]

Global Climate Models (GCMs), like the Community Earth System Model Version 2 (CESM2), lack the fine spatial resolution needed for robust local assessments in the MHI. We addressed this limitation by producing the first dynamically downscaled projections of OA for the region spanning 2000-2100 using a coupled Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) and Carbon, Ocean Biogeochemistry and Lower Trophics (COBALT) model nested within CESM2 outputs.

Three climate scenarios representing different emission pathways were analyzed: [@cr-ssps]

- SSP1-2.6: Strongly declining emissions (CO₂ peaks at 474 ppm in 2063, declining to 445 ppm by 2100)
- SSP2-4.5: Slowly declining emissions (CO₂ reaching 603 ppm by 2100)
- SSP3-7.0: Increasing emissions, baseline outcome of current trends (CO₂ reaching 871 ppm by 2100)

These Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) represent plausible futures based on different assumptions about global climate policy, economic development, and population growth.

Our projections track three key indices that measure OA's impact on coral calcification: aragonite saturation state (Ωₐ), pH, and substrate-to-inhibitor ratio (SIR, [HCO₃⁻]/[H⁺]). Under SSP3-7.0, all OA indices decline rapidly and continuously throughout the century. SSP2-4.5 exhibits intermediate trends, with values stabilizing mid-century. Under SSP1-2.6, the decline is slower and may stabilize or slightly reverse after 2060. These projected decreases in Ωₐ, pH and SIR indicate increasing OA and suggest that coral reefs may face greater difficulty maintaining calcification rates, with the extent and timing of these shifts determined by future emissions trajectories. [@cr-temp-dic-trends]

:::{#cr-temp-dic-trends}
![](/assets/images/lucia/arag_sat_ph_sir_trends.png){.resize-img}
:::

We also introduced a climate novelty metric to determine when future ocean conditions might move outside the range that coral reefs have experienced in recent history, providing a framework for contextualizing ecological risk. This metric quantifies how much projected values of OA indices, Ωₐ, pH, and SIR, depart from the natural variability observed during a reference period (2005–2020), expressed as the ratio of the anomaly to historical variability. For example, a novelty value of 2 indicates that the anomaly is twice the reference variability, suggesting conditions substantially different from recent historical experience. This approach allows us to identify when and where coral reefs may encounter unprecedented chemical conditions that could exceed their adaptive capacity. [@cr-novelty-metric-concept]

:::{#cr-novelty-metric-concept}
![](/assets/images/lucia/novelty_metric_concept.png)
:::

Results show that, under all scenarios, Ωₐ will eventually surpass historical variability ranges, with the magnitude and timing of change strongly dependent on future CO₂ emissions. Under SSP3-7.0, mean Ωₐ novelty reaches approximately 12 times the reference variability by 2100, while SIR novelty reaches 9 times reference levels. In contrast, SSP1-2.6 shows much lower impacts, with Ωₐ novelty peaking at 3 times reference variability mid-century before declining to around 1 by century's end. For SIR, novelty values remain low in SSP1-2.6, peaking at about 3 before gradually returning near present-day levels, while SSP2-4.5 plateaus at intermediate values of around 6 for Ωₐ and 4 for SIR by 2100. These results indicate that, even under the lowest emission scenario, some departure from historical conditions is unavoidable, but the extent of change and potential risk to coral reef adaptation are much greater under higher emissions. The shaded regions in the figure reflect the range across nearshore locations, highlighting spatial variability in projected outcomes. [@cr-novelty-metric-results]

:::{#cr-novelty-metric-results}
![](/assets/images/lucia/novelty_metric_results.jpg){.resize-img}
:::

The spatial distribution of novelty was also analyzed, revealing that both the timing and intensity of exposure to novel conditions vary by location, with windward (northeast-facing) coastlines generally showing higher novelty values. The spatial patterns differ between OA indices: for Ωₐ, novelty tends to increase from south to north, while for SIR, the highest values are found along eastern coastlines. Leeward (southwest) areas, which experience higher baseline variability, generally show lower novelty. These patterns highlight pronounced differences in potential ecological risk across the islands and emphasize the importance of local conditions in shaping future OA impacts.

By the end of the century, nearly all reef areas are projected to experience ocean conditions outside the range observed in recent history. The high-resolution, scenario-based projections from this analysis characterize the local chemical and physical environments that shape coral reef exposure, providing the environmental inputs necessary for evaluating ecosystem responses under changing conditions.

## Coral reef fishery outcomes in the MHI under climate change

The Atlantis ecosystem model for the MHI was configured with 79 dynamically modeled boxes arranged across depth gradients, supplemented by 6 boundary boxes that facilitated nutrient and plankton replenishment through vertical mixing with deep-ocean layers. This spatial framework captured habitat diversity across 4 vertical layers extending from surface waters to deep sediment. [@cr-atlantis-boxes-map]

High-resolution projections of future ocean conditions, developed using ROMS/COBALT for three climate scenarios, were used to drive the Atlantis ecosystem model. Atlantis incorporated local nearshore environmental parameters for each scenario, including hydrodynamics, temperature, pH, salinity, and phytoplankton densities, to represent the changing conditions most relevant to shallow coral reefs in the MHI.

The model incorporated region-specific biological responses derived from meta-analyses of tropical Pacific species. The ecosystem was structured into 59 functional groups categorized by feeding behavior and habitat preferences. Coral bleaching thresholds were set at 28°C, with adaptive capacity represented by a 0.2°C tolerance increase per decade. While lower trophic levels were modeled as biomass aggregations, key species including coral genera, parrotfish, monk seals, and sea turtles received detailed age-structured representation. Historical fishing patterns informed the configuration of six gear-specific fishery sectors. [@cr-atlantis-trophic-pyramid]

Model outputs were analyzed using a comprehensive vulnerability assessment framework adapted from Marshall et al. (2009), which integrates exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity to quantify ecosystem and community-level climate risks across the MHI. [@cr-vulnerability-framework]

Ecological exposure was quantified using Atlantis model projections spanning 2020-2100 under three climate scenarios. Environmental stressors including OA (declining pH), warming sea surface temperatures, and increased macroalgal biomass served as indicators of heightened exposure. Conversely, metrics of ecological integrity (coral cover, reef herbivore biomass, fish diversity, targeted fishery species abundance, megafauna populations, and mean trophic level) were incorporated as exposure-buffering indicators that enhance system resilience.

Community sensitivity was assessed through spatial analysis of marine resource dependence across the MHI. This evaluation encompassed both commercial and recreational fishery reliance, incorporating catch volumes, revenue streams, recreational fishing effort, and coastal site utilization patterns to characterize differential community vulnerability to marine ecosystem changes.

:::

Adaptive capacity was evaluated using the five-dimensional framework developed by Cinner et al. (2018), which encompasses assets, flexibility, social organization, learning, and agency as core determinants of community resilience. Assets were quantified through median household income, while flexibility was measured using occupational diversity indices. Social organization was assessed via internet access, reflecting contemporary patterns of community engagement and information sharing in policy processes. Learning capacity was evaluated through educational attainment rates (percentage of population with bachelor's degrees or higher), and agency was characterized using dual indicators of English proficiency and poverty status, both representing individual and collective capacity for autonomous decision-making. [@cr-adaptive-capacity]

Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) was employed to construct composite indices for each vulnerability dimension. This non-parametric approach scores system performance across multiple indicators without requiring subjective weighting schemes, instead deriving weights empirically from observed data patterns. The final vulnerability index was calculated as: $$V = \frac{E \times S}{AC},$$ reflecting the established relationship where exposure and sensitivity amplify vulnerability while adaptive capacity provides buffering effects.

Model simulations projected substantial declines in coral biomass under all climate scenarios. SSP1-2.6 demonstrated the greatest resilience, retaining approximately 60% of initial biomass by 2100. SSP2-4.5 showed moderate losses, declining to roughly 40% of baseline levels. SSP3-7.0 exhibited the most severe impacts, with coral biomass declining to approximately 25% of initial values by century's end. Coral declines were immediate in response to rising temperature, with additional delayed effects from OA. [@cr-coral-biomass]

Vulnerability index scores were spatially distributed across MHI communities, with the highest decile (top 10%) specifically labeled for analysis. Interpretations focus on identifying primary indicators driving elevated vulnerability scores, particularly examining communities with extreme exposure-sensitivity values or diminished adaptive capacity metrics.

O'ahu communities exhibit high sensitivity due to combined commercial fishery dependence and recreational site pressure.

Community adaptive capacity scores range from 0.83-1.0 across the MHI, with labeled communities representing the lowest decile. Lahaina exhibits reduced adaptive capacity driven by lower educational attainment and English proficiency. North Kohala demonstrates moderate values across all indicators without notable strengths. Papaikou-Wailea shows below-average performance on most metrics except occupational diversity. Pahoa-Kalapana records the lowest income and highest poverty rates of all assessed communities.

Initial conditions show uniformly low exposure across MHI communities. Mid-century projections indicate rising exposure in Maui County communities. End-century outcomes shift peak exposure away from Maui County, with high-exposure communities characterized by degraded ecosystem integrity metrics (reef fish diversity, herbivore biomass, targeted fishery species) and above-average temperature increases. Honolulu records the highest exposure index under SSP3 end-century projections. Primary exposure drivers include declining ecosystem integrity indicators and elevated temperature increases, with progressive concentration of environmental stress in urban coastal zones from dispersed moderate impacts to concentrated high-risk areas.

Vulnerability indices at the end-century reveal distinct community risk profiles across SSP1-3 scenarios. Ewa and Honolulu emerge as most vulnerable communities under SSP2-3, with Ewa driven by high exposure and above-average sensitivity, while Honolulu exhibits maximum sensitivity combined with moderate exposure (SSP2) escalating to highest exposure (SSP3). South Kona and Waianae represent peak vulnerability communities under SSP1-2, with South Kona recording highest exposure scores in SSP1 and second-highest in SSP2. Waianae demonstrates maximum sensitivity with moderate exposure in SSP1-2, but notably shifts to relatively lower vulnerability in SSP3 despite maintaining maximum sensitivity, due to comparatively reduced exposure levels relative to other communities.

## The socioeconomic impact of climate change on coral reef in the MHI

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-Slides-blue)](assets/slides/slides.pptx)

Projections of coral reef decline under climate change have major implications for the well-being of communities across the MHI, especially considering the central role reefs play in supporting coastal recreation, food security, and local economies. We developed a spatially explicit framework that links ecological projections from the Atlantis model with an economic valuation of changes in recreational reef use across the MHI to quantify these impacts.More actions

Our approach integrates several data sources and methods. First, we paired site-specific projections of future coral cover with detailed information on coastal access sites, recreational amenities, and state level population forecasts under each climate scenario. We then estimated changes in the welfare value of recreation using a parameterized model derived from a travel cost study of Maui residents, accounting for site amenities, ecological conditions and resident income. This allowed us to estimate both annual and cumulative welfare losses for residents under the three climate scenarios.

Our results show that climate-driven reef loss is projected to lead to substantial reductions in recreational value across the MHI. The greatest potential welfare loss scenarios are projected to occur under the lower climate emission scenarios due to larger increases in population under the corresponding scenarios, i.e. more individuals to experience the losses of coral cover. By the end of the century, cumulative welfare losses for residents are projected to be around $2.1 to $3.3 billion, with most impacts concentrated in the most populous islands. Spatial analysis reveals pronounced disparities: some communities face welfare losses more than five times greater per resident than others. Using the EPA's EJScreen, we further identified that many of the most affected locations are home to disadvantaged communities which face higher risk of environmental hazards.

Important uncertainties and limitations exist in this analysis. The methodology focused primarily on residents and does not include tourism values, greatly underestimating the overall economic values associated with coral reef decline. Projections of coral cover and population change are subject to model assumptions and future policy decisions. Nevertheless, the framework allows for transparent mapping of vulnerabilities and identifies where the need for adaptation or compensation may be greatest.

Our analysis reveals the economic stakes of climate-driven coral reef decline, the importance of spatial targeting in future management, and the need for policies that address both ecological resilience and social equity. Ongoing work should refine economic valuation, expand to other ecosystem services, and explore the benefits of different adaptation and restoration strategies for both people and reefs.

## Future directions for building resilience for Hawai'i's reefs and communities

Our research demonstrates that coral reefs in the MHI are projected to face unprecedented OA and warming, with far-reaching consequences for reef ecosystems, fisheries, and coastal communities. Across all modeled scenarios, significant declines in coral biomass are expected, accompanied by changes throughout the food web and negative effects on recreational and economic value. The magnitude and timing of these impacts depend on future emissions and will vary by location, with some areas and communities facing greater risks than others. While local management actions can provide some benefits, their effectiveness is limited as climate stress intensifies.

Our work emphasizes the importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, strengthening local management where possible, and investing in ongoing monitoring to improve our understanding of OA and ecosystem change. Adaptation strategies that are tailored to the spatial variability of impacts and that address both ecological and social vulnerability will be key to building resilience for MHI reefs and the people who depend on them. Further research should continue to refine models, incorporate additional ecosystem services, and inform policies that support both conservation and community well-being.
